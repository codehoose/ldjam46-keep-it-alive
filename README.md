Ludum Dare entry for #46 (Jam) - Keep it alive

## The Orb - Idea

Goal: Protect the orb in the centre of the room. At all costs!!
	  
Enemies:

	- Zombie. Slow moving, plain annoying, but will drop weapons or health packs
	- Freezer. Slow moving, if you hit it and you're in the blast radius it will
	  freeze you temporarily
	- Fireman. Fast moving. Will set you ablaze for a period of time depleting
	  your life. Will drop health packs only, sometimes.

Pickups:
	
	- Health packs to replenish your energy. They appear randomly(?)
	- Weapon upgrades. The zombies carry weapons, but they can't use them (too stupid)

End game:
	- For you there is no end game, just protect the orb as long as you can. It's
	  horde mode, son!
	- Orb can be destroyed if it takes too many hits
